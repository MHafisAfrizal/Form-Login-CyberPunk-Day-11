# Form-Login-CyberPunk-Day-11
Cyberpunk Login Form
A stunning, futuristic, and highly aesthetic login form with a cyberpunk theme, featuring a 3D aurora background, neon glowing effects, glitch animations, and an interactive sound experience. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js for a mesmerizing user interface.
Features

Futuristic 3D Background: Dynamic aurora effect using Three.js with WebGL shaders, creating a vibrant neon flow (cyan, magenta, green).
Cyberpunk Aesthetics: Glitch-animated title with Orbitron font, glowing neon borders, and frosted glass form design.
Interactive Inputs: Floating labels with smooth transitions and neon glow effects on focus.
Animated Button: Gradient button with moving colors, hover lift, and glowing shadow effects.
Sound Effects: Button click sound for an immersive experience.
Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes with Tailwind CSS and dynamic WebGL resizing.
Minimal JavaScript: Basic login validation with themed alerts for demonstration.

Prerequisites

A modern web browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended for optimal WebGL performance).
Internet connection to load CDN resources (Tailwind CSS, Three.js, Google Fonts, and audio file).
A device with decent graphics capabilities for smooth WebGL rendering.

Installation

Clone or Download:
Clone this repository or download the index.html file from the artifact.

git clone <repository-url>


Place Files:
Ensure index.html is in your project directory. No additional files are required since all dependencies are loaded via CDN.


Run Locally:
Open index.html in a modern browser. For best results, use a local server to avoid CORS issues with the audio file:

npx http-server


Alternatively, use VS Code's Live Server extension or any static server.


Access:
Navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the port provided by your server) in your browser.



Usage

Open the form in a browser.
Enter a username and password in the input fields.
Click the "Login" button to trigger a themed alert and hear a click sound effect.
Experience the dynamic aurora background, glitchy title, and glowing neon effects.

Dependencies
All dependencies are loaded via CDN, so no local installation is required:

Tailwind CSS: For responsive and utility-first styling.
Three.js (r134): For WebGL-based 3D aurora background.
Google Fonts (Orbitron): For futuristic typography.
SoundJay: Public button click sound (button-09.mp3).

File Structure
cyberpunk-login-form/
└── index.html        # Main file containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Customization
To enhance or modify the form:

Background: Adjust the shader code in the fragmentShader section of index.html to change aurora colors or animation speed.
Styling: Modify Tailwind classes or custom CSS in the <style> tag for different colors, sizes, or effects.
Functionality: Replace the handleLogin function with real backend validation (e.g., API integration).
Sound: Swap the audio URL in the clickSound variable for a different sound effect.

Notes

The WebGL background may require a device with sufficient graphics performance for smooth rendering.
Ensure an internet connection to load CDN resources. For offline use, download and host the dependencies locally.
The form currently uses a simple alert for login. For production, integrate with a backend authentication system.
To update this artifact, use the same artifact_id (4ad41da7-c89d-4ac3-bffe-0ae642b5d7fe) with a new artifact_version_id.

Troubleshooting

WebGL Not Rendering: Ensure your browser supports WebGL 2.0 and your device has adequate GPU capabilities.
Audio Not Playing: Some browsers block auto-playing audio. Click the button to trigger the sound manually.
CORS Issues: Serve the project using a local server to avoid cross-origin restrictions with the audio file.
